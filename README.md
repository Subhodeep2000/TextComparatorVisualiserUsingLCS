This project is Text Comparator Visualiser in which Longest Common Subsequence algorithm is used(which is commonly used to find the longest possible common sequence between two text files).In this project,Dynamic Programming approach is used to find the LCS.This project contains five files-FileDiffer.py(implemented using python),LCS(usingpython),MarkedUp.html,TextA.txt(One file having text ) ,TextB.txt(Another file having text).
In this project we have shown how to differentiate and convert the text of one file(TextA.txt) to another text file(TextB.txt).
# Setup
There is no setup required! just run the fileDiffer.py
